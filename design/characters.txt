Then there's the matter of map character colours. Let's give a try to a couple of roguelikes out there:

- ADOM: The few dungeon features are generally coloured representatively: Doors, being wooden, are brown, beehives are yellow, pools are their water colour, etc.. A few monsters might hit their representative colour, but a lot of them are coloured rather imaginatively.
- Nethack: Colourless here for some reason,
