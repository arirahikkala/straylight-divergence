The first thing the game will do when started up is display a message on the screen, centered, on one line (if the chosen message is too long to be displayed on one line choose another one - most of these are easily below 78 characters, though). On first startup, use the first message. On any further startups, choose a message at random.

The messages are various rationalist, transhumanist, futurist, and other stuff-that-ari-approves-of slogans.
